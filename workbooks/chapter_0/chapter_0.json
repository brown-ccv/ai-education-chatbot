      "instructions": "The following question will make use of both part A and part B in Figure 1 below.  Please note that part B is only representing part of an operational model where some stuff comes out of the Wazoos and Wallybags boxes and goes into boxes not shown (could be several!) and eventually goes into the Widgets box.  Panel B is showing part of an operational model from a factory that tries to make the same number of widgets each day.  A by-product of widget production is wazoos, which ultimately slow down widget production as they need to be cleared from the equipment.  Wallybags are added to the widget production process by factory workers when an alarm indicates that too few widgets are being made.",
